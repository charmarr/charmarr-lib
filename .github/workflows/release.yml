  # NOTE: Publish steps are intentionally inlined here instead of using a reusable workflow.
  # PyPI Trusted Publishing does not support reusable workflows - the job_workflow_ref claim
  # must match the workflow configured in PyPI, which requires the pypi-publish action to run
  # directly in this workflow file. See: https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish/issues/166
